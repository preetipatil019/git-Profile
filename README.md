Welcome to my learning tutor 👋
I will be documenting my favourite technology learning journey in this series. I am learning React through Namaste React Live Course and many more 

About me 🙏 :
I'm Preeti Baliga and I worked as a software engineer 👩‍💻 in Mysore,Hyderabad,Bangalore (India) for 6+ years before moving to USA.

I took a decision of taking a break from my career to spend time on my family. Currently, I am full-time parent 🤱 (on a career break for 3 years now), taking care of my toddler 👨‍👩‍👧 and slowly rebooting myself to bounce back to work.

It's never too late to restart our careers. I am ready to start it all again with a strong foundation than before. In my career reboot 2.0 journey, I am revising all the front-end core skills like javascript, CSS, HTML, and other libraries. There are a lot of new features to catch up on that were released in the meantime. Learning react was on top of my list. I am glad that I got the opportunity to learn React from Akshay Saini to kick start, which delivers clear explanations for all core-js concepts.

I am currently looking for job opportunities in USA (Remote and Hybrid). If you have any leads that match my skills, please let me know on LinkedIn.
